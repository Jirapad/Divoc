# Divoc

Language: Python

Framework/Modules: Kivy, HERE, SQL Database

Divoc is a Covid-19 danger-zones detector application designed during the Smart-City Hackathon Competition, sponsored by AWS Amazon, Depa Thailand, and KrungThai. 
In this competition, we were inspired by the rising of Covid-19 Cases in Thailand. So we created an application to track the places where Covid-19 vitims went. The process of tracking
is that Divoc will work with hospitals. After recieving the data, Divoc will update into the SQL database which will be displayed onto the users' Map which was cloned from HERE Developer Technologies.
